Hyperskill-Challenging: PasswordHacker

Hyperskill-Hard: Multilingual Online Translator, Text-Based Browser, To-Do List


<h3>PasswordHacker</h3>
You must connect to a secret server without knowing the password. Your task is to write a Python program that can hack this password, and do so in the quickest way possible.

<h3>Multilingual Online Translator</h3>
In this project, youâ€™re about to write an app that translates the words you type and gives you many usage examples based on the context.

<h3>Text-Based Browser</h3>
Having the option to read online documentation or find something on the Internet from the command line or terminal can really come in handy. Let's use Python to create a text-based browser. In this project, you will create a simplified browser that will ignore JS and CSS, won't have cookies, and only will show a limited set of tags. But it will still be good enough for some situations, and building it will be fun!

<h3>To-Do List</h3>

To-Do list can improve your work and personal life. You can use it to reduce the stress in your life and get more done in less time. It also helps you become more reliable for other people and save time for the best things in life. So let's implement it!
